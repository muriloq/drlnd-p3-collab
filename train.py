""" A script for training a DDPG agent in the multi-agent Tennis environment of Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning nanodegree (Project 3).
Learning statistics will be printed in the standard output; a plot of the progress will be saved in file training.png.
After completion, neural network weights will be saved in files checkpoint_actor.pth checkpoint_critic.pth. 
This code is heavily based on the proposed exercise, with small changes for compatibility with the Unity environment, and use in the command-line.
